                I was around for the dawn of the internet (jk, but not really :-) As a youth 
                I wrote several Geocities pages.  In fact, I have have been coding since 
                1996. Recently, I've been taking my coding skills to the next level!
                make website a game where you level up, using something similar to star bbs.

                I love playing music, and I play several instruments. My favorite book is 'The Republic' 
                and my 3rd favorite
                movie is the original 1954 Godzilla.  Also, I grew up in Alaska.
