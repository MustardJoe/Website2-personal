                Hi Iâ€™m Jon!  Welcome to my internet home (away from home). I'm a 
                software devoloper (he/him pronouns) who lives in Portland, Or.

            I would describe myself as an intelligent, empathetic and diligent individual
            with a quiet but quirky sense of humor, and a passion for continuous learning.
            The most important thing to me in a job is being part of a great fitting team 
            that works well together and supports each other.

                I love playing music, and I play several instruments. My favorite book is 'The Republic' 
                and my 3rd favorite
                movie is the original 1954 Godzilla.  Also, I grew up in Alaska.
