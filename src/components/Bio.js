                Iâ€™ve spent the last 12+ years solving problems using technical
                knowledge and expertise.
                Before transitioning into software, I spent many years working with a 
                technical focus on hardware.  As a BioMedical Equipment Technician (BMET) 
                I worked a hosptial conducting servicing and repair of all types of medical 
                devices.  Prior to that I spent a decade as a bicycle mechanic, specializing
                in both repair work and customer service.
